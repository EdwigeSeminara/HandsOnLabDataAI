The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. 
Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Exhaust Vacuum (V) and the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
